                         this Jerry teamed up with Risotto Groupon to kill Rick. Doubt he can
                         even pull it off but I guess I'll find out

                        <p>F**king *burp* Jerry deserves a round of applause for this one. Get this! He wanted to make his dog smarter
                          so he got (c-137) Rick to build a helmet for the dog and now this damn fur*burppp* ball is trying to enslave 
                          the human race! What the f**k is up with C-132 man. I might actually just watch this play out...

                            this version of Morty (are all Morty's this stupid) she has been getting reckless by slashing tires and burning
                            peoples home. Who knows wh-*burrp* else she can do?!
